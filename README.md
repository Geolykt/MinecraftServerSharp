# MinecraftServerSharp
Minecraft server implementation in C#

âš¡ This implementation aims to provide great performance by utilising modern practises, new technologies, and few allocations.  
ðŸ§µ Threading many aspects of the server is of great importance as modern/server processors usually have plenty of cores.  
ðŸ§© Plugins will play a big role in implementing game logic and later on extensibility like many mainstream Minecraft servers.
